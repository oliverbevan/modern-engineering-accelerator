      <p>Bash is an UNIX shell and command language written by Brian Fox which was first released in 1989.
        Bash is a command processor that typically runs in a text window where the user types commands that cause actions.
        Bash can also read and execute commands from a file, called a shell script.
        Like all Unix shells, it supports filename globbing (wildcard matching), piping, here documents, command substitution, variables, and control structures for condition-testing and iteration.</p>
